# Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification

This repository contains code for an image classification pipeline that distinguishes between cats and dogs. The pipeline includes data loading, preprocessing, and training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model.

## Features

- Loading image datasets from directories for both training and testing.
- Preprocessing images, including normalization.
- Constructing and training a CNN model with multiple Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers.
- Displaying and preprocessing a single image for prediction.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow and Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   
   git clone https://github.com/PrathamMMallya/Cats-Vs-Dogs-Classification.git
   cd Cats-Vs-Dogs-Classification
   
## Results
The trained model achieves reasonable accuracy in distinguishing between cats and dogs. The script also allows for single image prediction, displaying both the original and grayscale versions of the input image before making a prediction.
